# Iris-dataset-EDA-ML-Project
This program applies basic machine learning concepts on Iris Data to predict the species of a new sample of a new sample of Iris of flower.

* Software and Libraries
  * Python 
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Scikit-lrean

* Introduction:

    The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Iris flower data set is a multivariate dataset.

* The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
* Four features were measured from each sample (in centimeters):
  * Length of the sepals
  * Width of the sepals
  * Length of the petals
  * Width of the petals

# Conclusion:
SVM model accuracy is 95.555

Logistic Regression Model Accuracy is 93.333 

Decision Tree Model Accuracy is 91.111

We can see that SVM model is producing the better accuracy than Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Models.
