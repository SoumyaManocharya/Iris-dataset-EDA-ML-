# Iris-dataset-EDA-ML-Project
This program applies basic machine learning concepts on Iris Data to predict the species of a new sample of a new sample of Iris of flower.

* Software and Libraries
  * Python 
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Scikit-lrean

* Introduction:

    The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Larning Repository. The Iris flower data set is a multivariate dataset.

* The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
* Four features were measured from each sample (in centimeters):
  * Lenght of the sepals
  * Width of the sepals
  * Lenght of the petals
  * Width of the petals
